# Kits-Redeems
A premium function and freebie functional plugin.

Has two major commands, /kit and /redeem.

Redeem was a command that could be used only once a 'map reset', so 
if you never ever reset the playable map then this command was a one-time-use.

Kits were used as a buffer towards redeems, you would essentially 
set a cooldown for their use so that they could be used multiple times during
one play session.

Other commands...
- setkit
- setredeem
- delredeem
- delkit
- listredeem / rlist
- resetredeem <player>
